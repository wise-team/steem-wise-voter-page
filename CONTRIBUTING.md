## Ground Rules

- Ensure you did `npm run build` to test if your change compiles well, and is compliant with tslint clean code rules
- Run `npm serve`, visit the page in the browser and test it manually.
- Create an issue (add tag enhancement or bug) before adding a pull request
- Think twice before adding a new file, but do not hesitate to do that if it increases the readability of the code.
- Your code tells who you are. Make it art. Keep it quality and beautiful.
- Be welcoming and warm to the others. See our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/noisy-witness/steem-wise-core/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).



## Your First Contribution

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github), 

Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.



## Getting started

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough not to be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   - Run `npm run build` to check compilation errors. Build also runs the linter that ensures the quality of the code.
   - Run `npm serve`, visit the page in the browser and test it manually.
   - See our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/noisy-witness/steem-wise-core/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
4. Send a pull request.



## How to report a bug

### Security issues

**Important**! If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Please email jedrzejblew@gmail.com.

To determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, send an email to jedrzejblew@gmail.com.



### Other issues

When creating an issue please fill the following template:

> **The problem**:
> **I did**:
>
> **I expected to see**:
>
> **Instead, I saw**:
>
> **Version of steem-wise-core**: 
> **Version of nodejs**:
> **Links to gist with output / logs (or at least a picture):**
> **Links to transactions on steemd.com:**

Also please properly **tag the issue**. E.g. with the tag "bug".



## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Add an issue in issues panel on GitHub, and describe what feature would you like to see in Wise. The more detailed the description is, the better. Please add the **"enhancement" tag**.
